* Things I want to try for emacs config
** compile-file
When loading in custom configurations for emacs it would be nice if I checked for a compiled file. Then, if one exists 
load that file. Otherwise, compile one and load the compiled file.
** db example
The db example for cds might be a fun way to store packages that i am using.
